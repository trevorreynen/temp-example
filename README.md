# Temporary title

As I do with most other projects, I am going to be using a personal log file called "trevors-log.txt". It will contain nearly everything I do along with notes if I feel the need to take notes for whatever reason. It's unorganized and probably not useful for anyone except myself. However, in case I need to reference something in the future, I will have that file.

On a side note, I also use two formatters: EditorConfig and Prettierrc, extensions in VSCode. The two files in my project root containing settings for these formatters are hidden.
