# Purpose Financial â€“ Junior Web Developer Coding Challenge

As I do with most other projects, I am going to be using a personal log file called "trevors-log.txt". It will contain nearly everything I do along with notes if I feel the need to take notes for whatever reason. It's unorganized and probably not useful for anyone except myself. However, in case I need to reference something in the future, I will have that file.

On a side note, I also use two formatters: EditorConfig and Prettierrc, extensions in VSCode. The two files in my project root containing settings for these formatters are hidden.

#### Instructions

- Create an app that will display 10 cards in two rows of 5.
- When the app starts, all 10 cards should be face down.
   - Each card should display a random image from this free API.
      - https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
- When a card is clicked it will flip over and display its faceup side.
- The faceup side of the card needs to have the following parts displayed, from top to bottom:
   - Header
   - Body
   - Footer
- The face side of the card can display anything in each section, but each card must have a unique face side.
- Use VueJS to develop the app.
- Submit the app via public Github Repo with only 1 branch.
- You will have 3 business days to complete the Take Home Coding Challenge.
