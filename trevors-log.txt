I already have Vue installed through NodeJS before beginning project.

    Terminal: C:\GitHub\Purpose-Financial>
        vue create frontend
        !!!! NOTE: These are the setup prompts and my choices. Lines with the "?" are the prompts, lines with "-" are my selected options. This section ends with the next "!!!!"
            Vue CLI v5.0.8
            ? Please pick a preset:
                - Manually select features
            ? Check the features needed for your project:
                - Babel, Router, Vuex, CSS Pre-processors
            ? Choose a version of Vue.js that you want to start the project with
                - 3.x
            ? Use history mode for router? (Requires proper server setup for index fallback in production)
                - Yes
            ? Pick a CSS pre-processor (PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSS Modules are supported by default):
                - Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)
            ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.?
                - In dedicated config files
            ? Save this as a preset for future projects?
                - No
        !!!! (I chose these options because I have done a simple tutorial project with these options. Probably wont really need any of them but I believe I can always remove if needed.)
        cd frontend

    Terminal: C:\GitHub\Purpose-Financial\frontend>
        npm run serve
