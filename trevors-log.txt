I already have Vue installed through NodeJS before beginning project.

Log:
    Terminal: C:\GitHub\...>
        vue create frontend
        !!!! NOTE: These are the setup prompts and my choices. Lines with the "?" are the prompts, lines with "-" are my selected options. This section ends with the next "!!!!"
            Vue CLI v5.0.8
            ? Please pick a preset:
                - Manually select features
            ? Check the features needed for your project:
                -
            ? Choose a version of Vue.js that you want to start the project with
                - 3.x
            ? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.?
                - In dedicated config files
            ? Save this as a preset for future projects?
                - No
        !!!!
        cd frontend

    Terminal: C:\GitHub\...\frontend>
        npm run serve
        npm install axios


Biggest problems:
    1. I didn't have contact to anyone who could have helped me, or who this challenge is for. Which left many questions I had about what is expect in the air and I just had to guess.
        - Was I able to use plugins other than axios which I assume is absolutely required for receiving images from an api?
        - What exactly is expected for the face of the card being unique? Is it okay to do what I did do and just say "Card One" "Card Two" and so on? Technically that is unique but..
    2. Looking anything up for this challenge to help (because of problem #1 I resulted to doing this) was near pointless. Some of it was trial and error, some of it was referencing a previous vue project of mine.

Notes after completing:
    - I assume this could have been done in a more efficient way but I am not that good with vue.
